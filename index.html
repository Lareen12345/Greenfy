  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter the waste from the 'Enter' opening.</li>
    <li>Choose the correct opening based on the type of waste (paper, plastic, metal, glass).</li>
    <li>After that, the machine recycles and produces a new product from the materials you previously input! wonderful,right?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why does it important?</h2>
  <ol>
    <P>Everyone talking abouty recycling but why? Because there are a lot of benifits!</P>
    <li>Recycling Prevents Pollution
Recycling helps prevent air pollution (e.g., incineration) and water and ground pollution (e.g., landfills). It also reduces the number of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, which helps to fight climate change.</li>
    <li>Recycling Helps Protect the Planet
Recycling helps protect our planet, natural resources, and the environment by converting products into new materials at the end of their life cycle. For example, a can of soda can be re-manufactured and reused.

Recycling an old can into a new can saves over 95% of the energy required to make a can from virgin materials.</li>
    <li>Recycling Saves Energy & Natural Resources
Recycling ensures that the energy and raw materials used to make items and products do not go to waste. It also reduces the need to extract and refine new resources and process raw materials.</li>
    <li>Recycling Reduces Waste Produced
Recycling allows products to be used to their fullest potential. Most items that are disposed of have hardly been used and are only being disposed of because they no longer serve a purpose. It is estimated that up to 75% of all waste can be recycled or repurposed.</li>
    <li>Recycling Reduces Waste Sent to Landfills
Recycling reduces the amount of garbage we send to landfills. When waste sits rotting away in landfills, it leeches toxins into the groundwater and soil. It gives off greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide like methane as it decomposes, contributing to global warming.</li>
    <p>Everyone sees how the climate change effects us, so what's your opinion now?</p>
